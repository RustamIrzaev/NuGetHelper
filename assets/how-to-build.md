# NuGet Helper

## Building the tool

If you want to create a build on your own, just follow these steps:

* Clone the repository

* Run a build script depending on your OS:

   ### Mac\Linux

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

   ### Windows

   ```powershell
   .\build.ps1
   ```

* When the script completes, you will find a ready-to-use build in a `build` folder.
